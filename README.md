# Data Structure
1. **What is data structures?**
    - A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

2. **Why data structures?**
    - Ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
    - Help to manage and organize data
    - Make code cleaner and easier to understand

3. **What is Abstract data type (ADT)?**
    - Abstraction of a data structure which provide only necessary interface
    - Not give any details about implementation or what programming language is
      used
    
4. **Time complexity and Space complexity**
    - Time complexity: How much time does the algorithm need to finish.
    - Space complexity: How much space does the algorithm need for its computation.
